# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility or task. In simpler terms, a class should be designed to perform a single function or job. This principle emphasizes that if a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes more complex and harder to maintain.

- For example, consider a class that handles both user authentication and user data management. If changes are needed for user authentication, it may inadvertently affect user data management, leading to potential bugs or issues. By adhering to the SRP, you would separate these responsibilities into different classes, ensuring that each class only has one reason to change.

- The principle promotes cleaner, more manageable code and helps prevent the complications that arise from having classes that do too much. It also facilitates easier testing and debugging since each class can be tested independently based on its specific responsibility.

- Hierarchy and Abstraction: The speaker explains the importance of creating a hierarchy in class design, using abstract classes and interfaces. This allows for better organization of classes and ensures that each class adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. The use of interfaces serves as a contract that defines what a class can do without revealing how it does it.

- Client-Server Relationship: The concept of a client is introduced, which can be any software application or user that utilizes the class. The relationship between the client and the class is crucial, as the client should only interact with the class through defined interfaces, ensuring that the implementation details remain hidden.
