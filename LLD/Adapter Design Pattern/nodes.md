# Adapter design pattern

- The adapter design pattern serves as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together. In the context provided in the transcript, the pattern is explained through an example involving existing code and a third-party library.

- Purpose of the Adapter: The adapter's main role is to enable communication between the existing code and the third-party library without tightly coupling them. The existing code does not need to know the specifics of the third-party library; it only interacts with the adapter.

- Scenario: The existing code expects data in a certain format (JSON), while the third-party library provides data in a different format (XML). To resolve this incompatibility, an adapter is introduced.

- Implementation:

    - An adapter class (e.g., XMLDataProviderAdapter) is created. This class implements the interface expected by the existing code (target interface) and adapts the output from the third-party library (adaptive interface).
    The adapter overrides methods to convert the data from XML to JSON. When the existing code calls the adapter's method, the adapter retrieves the XML data from the third-party library, converts it to JSON, and returns it to the existing code.
    Benefits:

    - Decoupling: The existing code remains independent of the third-party library. If the library changes or is replaced, only the adapter needs to be modified, not the existing code.
    Flexibility: The adapter allows for easy integration of different libraries or systems without altering the existing codebase.
    UML Diagram: The transcript mentions a standard UML diagram for the adapter pattern, which typically includes:

    - A target interface that the existing code interacts with.
    - An adaptive interface that the third-party library implements.
    - The adapter class that implements the target interface and interacts with the adaptive interface.

- In summary, the adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by introducing an adapter that translates calls between them, promoting flexibility and reducing tight coupling in the code.
