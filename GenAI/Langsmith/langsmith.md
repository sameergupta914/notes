# Langsmith

- Langsmith is a tool that allows you to trace the execution of your code without needing to change anything in your code. It automatically tracks every execution, input, output, and intermediate steps when you run your application.

# Observability 

- in Langsmith refers to the ability to track and monitor various metrics across multiple traces to assess the overall health of your LLM (Large Language Model) system. It aggregates metrics such as latency, token usage, cost, error rates, and success rates. You can set up alerts to notify you when these metrics drift outside acceptable ranges. Additionally, it involves tracing every execution, input, and output, as well as all intermediate states or steps in the process.
