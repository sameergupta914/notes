# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Trilogy: Trailer Overview

## 3. The Automation Workflow (3 Phases)

The process is managed by **Claude** (the main AI/Host application), connected to various tools via MCP.

#### Integrated Tools (via MCP)
Claude's capabilities are extended by connecting it to:

| Tool Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Research** | Web Search, GitHub, arXiv, Product Hunt, Twitter/X |
| **Context/Data** | Google Drive (Content Ideas, Performance Data), Gmail (Audience Feedback) |
| **System** | Local File System, Calendar |

#### Phase 1: Research (One Prompt)
1.  **Context Gathering:** Claude reads files from **Google Drive** and analyzes **Gmail** feedback to determine relevant research topics.
2.  **Parallel Research:** Claude uses the five external research tools (Web Search, GitHub, etc.) to gather data on the chosen focus areas.
3.  **Output:** **Five separate Markdown files** are generated and saved to the local desktop.

#### Phase 2: Editing (One Prompt)
1.  **Input:** Claude reads the **five research files** and a **Sample Template** from Google Drive.
2.  **Action:** It acts as an **Assembly Agent**, merging the content into a cohesive draft according to the 9-section structure.
3.  **Output:** A single **Final Draft Markdown file** is saved.

#### Phase 3: Designing (One Prompt)
1.  **Input:** Claude reads the **Final Draft Markdown file** and detailed design specifications.
2.  **Output:** It generates two final, production-ready files:
    * An **HTML email template** (fully styled).
    * A **Plain Text** fallback version.

## 4. The Power of MCP: Minimal Code

The core benefit demonstrated is the ability to build a powerful, multi-tool AI workflow with **extremely minimal developer code**.

* **Configuration-Only:** Integrating complex external systems (like GitHub, Drive, etc.) only required writing simple **JSON configuration blocks** for each tool.
* **MCP Handles Logic:** The developer avoids writing custom API calls or business logic. The **MCP servers** handle all the complex tool execution and communication.
* **Conclusion:** MCP allows developers to rapidly make their AI agents vastly more capable by connecting them to an ecosystem of tools using a **standardized, low-overhead protocol**.
